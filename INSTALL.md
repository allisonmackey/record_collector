[Click here](https://dataschool.com/learn-sql/how-to-start-a-postgresql-server-on-mac-os-x/) for instructions on installing psql and Postgres.
After installing the above software, users will need to clone this project from my [github repository](https://github.com/JoseyKinnaman/record_collector). Once cloned, use the command line to navigate to the project folder and install all necessary Ruby Gems with: 
* _$ bundle install_
In the command line, type the following commands which will create the necessary database and launch a local server sso that you can access the application in a browser window.
* _$ rake db:create_
* _$ rake db:migrate_
* _$ rake db:test:prepare_
* _$ rails s_
Now open a web browser and enter localhost:3000 in the address bar to view the project.
